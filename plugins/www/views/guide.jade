				h1 Chapter 1: Wat?
				p
					| You may be asking yourself. What the hell is Mikuia?
					br
					| FEAR NOT! I'm here to explain the overall idea, basics, current state of pop-culture, and much more!
					br
					| Basically, Mikuia is a Twitch.tv bot designed to be customizable like a '85 Toyota Supra.
					br
					| You may have noticed already, maybe not, that it's pretty different from the other bots.
					br
					| The first big difference is that you start with 
					b no commands at all.
					br
					i.text-primary WAIT WHAT? NO COMMANDS? WTF.
					br
					b SHUT UP. 
					| While the other bots give you a huge amount of features, you probably won't need all of them.
					br
					| That's why Mikuia gives you a full control of the enabled commands, and their names.
					br
					| Let's start then.

				h1 Chapter 2: Starting it up.
				p
					i.text-primary Hurr durr, how do I even start it up.
					br
					| Please, it's pretty self-explanatory.
					br
					| There is a button on the navigation bar called "Login with Twitch".
					br
					| Guess what it does. 
					br
					i.text-primary SANDWICHES FOR SCHOOL?
					br
					| Sigh, no. It logs you in with Twitch.
					br
					i.text-primary OOOOH. I GUESS I WAS JUST SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT. THIS IS BUGGED.
					br
					| I hate you already. Anyways, after you login, click your username in top right corner, and select Settings.
					br
					| Pretty easy, huh?
					br
					i.text-primary Instructions not clear enough. Got my dick stuck in the fan.
					br
					| What? How the... fuck it, just notice the Enable Mikuia button. It's pretty useful.
					br
					i.text-primary You want me to click it or something? Too much work.
					br
					| Fuck you.

				h1 Chapter 3: Understanding plugins.
				p
					i.text-primary OH I KNOW I KNOW!!!111oneoneoene
					br
					| You know what, genius?
					br
					i.text-primary I KNOW WHAT PLUGINS ARE!!!!!!!11
					br
					| You? What? How?
					br
					i.text-primary THIS IS JUST LIKE MINECRAFT!
					br
					| Oh my god. You are a retard.
					br
					| Anyways, enabling Mikuia gives you results similar to singletapping Big Black on HR DT without sound,
					br
					|  while being blindfolded and repeatedly shot in the arm with a BB gun.
					br
					b YOU GET FUCKING NOTHING.
					br
					| First thing you want to do, is navigating to Plugins.
					br
					| There you can find a (currently pretty limited) selection of plugins.
					br
					| Select the ones you need, for example if you play osu!, enable the 'osu' plugin.
					br
					| Plugins give you commands, sometimes event handlers, and many other features.
					br
					i.text-primary HURR DURR YOU RIPPED IT OFF MINECRAFT
					br
					| God help me.

				p
					| Great. You've enabled some plugins.
					br
					| There is a big chance one of them added some stuff to the Settings page.
					br
					| Go back there, and check!
					br
					i.text-primary Yeah, I have no idea what to do.
					br
					| Um, fill the inputs and check the boxes?
					br
					i.text-primary Ain't nobody have time for that.
					br
					| Why don't you just leave then?
					br
					i.text-primary ...I don't know.

				h1 Chapter 5: Time for commands!
				p
					| You finally configured the basic stuff.
					br
					| Now, you can start adding commands!
					br
					i.text-primary Um... I guess it's the Commands page then?
					br
					| My god, you're learning! I didn't think it was ever going to happen!
					br
					i.text-primary So... I should put a command name here. !rank it is!
					br
					b I TAKE THAT BACK. 
					| ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND? THERE IS FUCKING RED TEXT OVER THERE.
					br
					i.text-primary Heh. I can't read.
					br
					| AAAAAAAAAARHGHGHGHGHGHG.
					br
					| Just... try to understand the concept. You don't put the prefix here.
					br
					| Someday, you may need to change the prefix from an exclamation mark to something else.
					br
					| Would you prefer changing it in one place or modifying every single command?
					br
					i.text-primary Yes.
					br
					| Leave.
					.text-muted.text-small There are currently #{wrongCommands} commands starting with an exclamation mark. Get your shit together, people.

					br
					i.text-primary Come at me, bro.
